This is the DOM manipulation project from the JavaScript course, on the The Odin Project page.
The grid is working properly, and there is a button with which the user can input his desired number of squares (8, 16 which is default, 32 or 64);

It is also all within the 960px width that is requested.

Added the optional color change.
